                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        I am Monisha, a passionate sophomore student at Mahindra University, pursuing Artificial Intelligence. 
                        From the very beginning of my first year, I fell in love with coding. It all started during my summer break 
                        when I dived into Python and gradually found myself deeply enamored by its possibilities. I participated in 
                        the IIIT Hyderabad Megathon as an individual participant, where I developed an application on face recognition. 
                        Though I didn't win a prize, it marked the beginning of my university journey and a running application that I 
                        was truly proud of.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Coding Journey:</strong>
                        With that initial motivation, I embarked on a journey to improve my coding skills. Over time, I became proficient 
                        in C, C++, and Python. I even dabbled in MATLAB and worked with a professor on an app development project, 
                        calculating design lateral force at different floors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My enthusiasm for coding led me to become a Bot developer at SysCom, an Enigma Committee at Mahindra University. 
                        I actively participated in various competitions, starting with the IIIT Hyderabad Megathon, where I had a thrilling 
                        experience of developing an application within a day and presenting it before companies. One of my memorable 
                        achievements was securing the third prize in the Bridge-it competition, where my team built a sturdy bridge using 
                        ice cream sticks.

                        <strong>TwiceStyled - A Responsible Start-up:</strong>
                        Passionate about responsible consumption and decent work, I founded a small start-up named TwiceStyled. 
                        Our mission was to transform discarded denim into unique and stylish products like hats, bags, phone cases, 
                        jewellery, and more. Through this venture, I learned the value of patience and creativity, and we even won the 
                        second prize at the Hult Prize for our innovative idea. Interacting with social media influencers and selling 
                        our products at E-summit added to the excitement of the journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the world of software development, I started my work with taking small milestones, including securing the 
                        second place in the 418 virtual hackathon. My project involved creating an application using Python, Django 
                        framework, and postGIS db, aimed at helping homeowners find suppliers for construction materials. The interface 
                        we designed also won us the third prize in a competition conducted by kis.ai.

                        <strong>Passion for Art:</strong>
                        Beyond the realm of coding and entrepreneurship, I nurture a deep passion for drawing. I am skilled in charcoal, 
                        acrylic, and oil painting, and I even won the second prize in the French Etincelle Poster Making competition 
                        held at my university.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe in keeping my surroundings clean and organized, and that includes regularly cleaning my laptop. 
                        Currently, I reside in the Mahindra University hostel, where I've made wonderful memories with my friends, 
                        especially during those exam day nights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With one year of university experience behind me, I look forward to achieving even greater heights and making my 
                        parents proud. I believe in approaching challenges with a smile and a determined spirit to excel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope you enjoy exploring my journey!
